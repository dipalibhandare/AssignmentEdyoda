Approaches:

1. First, we should check the port status using below command:

        sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

2. If the port is already listening, then what we can do is, we should check the services whether it is on ClusterIP or NodePort.

        cmd: - kubectl get svc

3. If it is of type ClusterIP, then we should change it to NodePort using :- kubectl edit service #servicename

4. After changing the type of Service then also if it is not working then we delete all the old pods and services and apply the replicaSet.yaml

   so that it will create the services again.

        cmd: - kubectl apply -f replicaSet.yaml

5. Thereafter, we will try to run the application. If it fails to run again then the last option is to change the port in replicaSet.yaml
